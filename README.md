# auto-establish-network-drives

Automatically opens and closes all network drives.

Personally created and used for making the red cross on Windows network shares update to green connection, this is when Windows for some reason refuses to keep the connection open and does not automatically etablish the connection on start-up, why does this matter? On some of our older softwares when it tries to open red crossed network shares it just sees them as unreachable.
